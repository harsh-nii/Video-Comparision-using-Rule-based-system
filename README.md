# Video Comparision using Rule Based System

This Python project evaluates and compares the quality of two videos based on various visual features. It uses OpenCV and NumPy to analyze key aspects such as sharpness, brightness, contrast, colorfulness, motion blur, edge density, and more to determine which video is visually superior.
